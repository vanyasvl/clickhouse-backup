## How to convert MergeTree to ReplicatedMergeTree
don't work for tables which created in `MergeTree(date_column, (primary keys columns), 8192)` format
1. Create backup
   ```
   clickhouse-backup create --table='my_db.my_table' my_backup
   ```
2. Edit `/var/lib/clickhouse/backup/my_backup/metadata/my_db/my_table.json`, change `query` field, 
   replace MergeTree() to ReplicatedMergeTree() with parameters according to https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication/#creating-replicated-tables
   

3. Drop table in Clickhouse
   ```
   clickhouse-client -q "DROP TABLE my_db.my.table NO DELAY"
   ```
4. Restore backup
   ```
   clickhouse-backup restore --rm my_backup
   ```

## How to store backups on NFS, backup drive or another server via SFTP
Use 'rsync'
'rsync' supports hard links with means that backup on remote server or mounted fs will be stored as efficiently as in the '/var/lib/clickhouse/backup'.
You can create daily backup by clickhouse-backup and sync backup folder to mounted fs with this command:
`rsync -a -H --delete --progress --numeric-ids --update /var/lib/clickhouse/backup/ /mnt/data/clickhouse-backup/` or similar for sync over ssh. In this case rsync will copy only difference between backups.

## How to monitor that backups created and uploaded correctly
Use services like https://healthchecks.io or https://deadmanssnitch.com.

## How to backup sharded cluster with Ansible
On the first day of month full backup will be uploaded and increments on the others days.

## How to backup database with several terabytes of data
You can use clickhouse-backup for creating periodical backups and keep it local. It protect you from destructive operations.
In addition you may create instance of ClickHouse on another DC and have it fresh by clickhouse-copier it protect you from hardware or DC failures.

## How do incremental backups work to remote storage
- Incremental backup calculate increment only during execute `upload` or `create_remote` command or similar REST API request.
- Currently, incremental backup calculate increment only on table parts level, look to ClicHouse documentation to fill the difference between [data parts](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/system-tables/parts/) and [table partitions](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/system-tables/partitions/).  
- To calculate increment, backup which listed on `--diff-from` parameter is required to be present as local backup, look to `clickhouse-backup list` command results for ensure.
- Currently, during execute `clickhouse-backup upload --diff-from=base_backup` don't check `base_backup` exits on remote storage, be carefull.
- During upload operation `base_backup` added to current backup metadata as required. All data parts which exists in `base_backup` also mark in backup metadata table level with `required` flag and skip data uploading. 
- During download, if backup contains link to `required` backup it will try to fully download first. This action apply recursively. If you have a chain of incremental backups, all incremental backups in the chain and first "full" will download to local storage. 
- Size of increment depends not only on the intensity your data ingestion and also depends on the intensity background merges for data parts in your tables. Please increase how much rows you will ingest during one INSERT query and don't apply often [table data mutations](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/system-tables/mutations/).
- Look to [ClicHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/) and try to understand how exactly `*MergeTree` table engine works.
